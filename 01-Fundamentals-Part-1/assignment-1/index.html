    <h3>LECTURE: Values and Variables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
            assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Log their values to the console
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>LECTURE: Data Types</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
            country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
            'language', but don't assign it any value yet
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
            to the console

    <h3>LECTURE: Basic Operators</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
            then how many people would live in each half?
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
        </li>
        <li>
            Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
            Finland?
        </li>
        <li>
            The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
            have less people than the average country?
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
            which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
            people speak portuguese'
        </li>
    </ol>
